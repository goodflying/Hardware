# FMUv3 Pixhawk Open Hardware Design

> **General information about Pixhawk designs, schematics, reference hardware, FMU versions, licensing, and trademarks, and contributing to the project can be found in the repo [README](../README.md).**

FMUv3 was introduced in 2015. Identical to FMUv2, it doubled the usable flash to 2MB.

The FMUv3 design is used in the Pixhawk 2 FC board.
This hardware is the result of a collaboration of the open hardware development community and 3D Robotics.


## Design Files

The design is provided in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/) CAD files.

It consists of schematic files (*.SchDoc), BOM listings, and includes open reference hardware PCB layouts (.PrjPcb). 

> **Tip** PDF versions of the schematics and PCB layouts has been made available for easy previewing (i.e. if you don't have Altium Designer).
