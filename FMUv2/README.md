# FMUv2 Pixhawk Open Hardware Design

> **General information about Pixhawk designs, schematics, reference hardware, FMU versions, licensing, and trademarks, and contributing to the project can be found in the repo [README](../README.md).**

FMUv2 combines the FMUv1 and I/O designs into a single package.
The open design provides both schematics and open reference layouts.


## Design Files

The design is provided in [EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) CAD files (can be viewed with the free version).

It consists of schematic files (*.sch) and includes open reference hardware PCB layouts (.brd). 
BOM management is performed using [Bob Starr's BOM-EX plugin](http://www.bobstarr.net/pages/downloads.html).

> **Tip** A PDF version of the schematics and PCB layouts has been made available for easy previewing: [PX4FMUv2.4.5.pdf](PX4FMUv2.4.5.pdf).
